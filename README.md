# osu-collection-exporter

Exports osu! collections into a list of maps and links to beatmaps. All operations are performed locally within your browser and is never uploaded anywhere.

NOTE: The FileReader API has a file size limit that varies between browsers (For instance: 231 MB on Chrome) so be wary of large osu!.db files
